@yngitnpm@n <command> [args]

@CCommands:@n 
     @Winit       @nConfigure current package to use an s3 ngitpm repository.
     @Wpublish    @nPublish current version to ngitpm repository.
     @Wlist       @nDisplay currently published versions.
     @Winstall    @nInstall a specified package and version in ngitpm repository.


@COptions:@n

    @Cinit@n:

    expects three arguments, <@Ws3 bucket/path@n>, <@Ws3 key@n> and <@Ws3 secret@n>.

    eg:

    $ @wngitpm init my-priv-bucket/repo KAIAITEOCMULOULCU2HA \ 
        bxVxpy0DkPU+1jju8WWGCBTBVj35QrWWH80hpgjT@n

    The s3 key and secret require write privs for publishing, and read to list
    or install. @RIt is recommended that you create seperate keys for these 
    purposes@n, and ensure that the bucket you use does not contain any sensitive
    information, as these keys will be stored in your package.json file(s).


    @Cpublish@n

    With no arguments, publish will use the current name, package version and 
    repository path in your package.json file, and the current commit hash.

        @W--force@n

        force will over-write any currently stored version in your ngitpm
        repository with the current details. This is not recommended.

        @W--commit=7739cbe@n

        Instead of detecting the commit hash from the current git repository, 
        provide an alternative commit hash.


    @Clist@n

    With no arguments, lists all packages in the repository.

        @W<package>@n

        List the available versions for @W<package>@n


    @Cinstall@n

    Install the package in the current package.json file as a direct git 
    dependency. This will REMOVE any current version of the package and then
    npm install the new version.
    
        @W<package>@n

        Name of the package to install, default to highest version.

        @W<version>@n (optional)
